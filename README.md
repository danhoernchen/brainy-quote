## 🛠️ Why I Made This Plugin

This plugin started as a **personal journaling tool** and a **learning project** for working with Obsidian plugins. While it’s still a work in progress, it successfully gets the job done: fetching and inserting quotes. I thought others might find it useful too, so here it is! 🎉

## 🚀 Future Plans

While functional, there’s still plenty of room for improvement. Some ideas I’m considering:

-   adding an option to fetch the quote images
-   Adding more categories or sources for quotes.
